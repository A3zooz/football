# 3D Football Penalty Shootout Game

## Project Overview

This project is a real-time 3D football (soccer) penalty shootout game developed from the ground up using C++ and the OpenGL graphics library. It serves as a practical demonstration of core computer graphics concepts, including 3D rendering pipelines, asset loading, lighting, texturing, and interactive camera control.

## Key Technical Features

*   **Real-Time 3D Rendering:** Utilizes the fixed-function pipeline in OpenGL to render a dynamic 3D scene, including a football field, player, ball, and goal.
*   **3D Model Loading:** Implements a loader for `.3DS` model files, enabling the integration of 3D assets for the player, goal, and other environmental objects.
*   **Lighting and Materials:** Features a configurable lighting system with ambient, diffuse, and specular components (`GL_LIGHT0`) to create a more immersive environment. Material properties are applied to objects to control how they reflect light.
*   **Texture Mapping:** Applies 2D textures to 3D objects to enhance visual detail. This is used for the football field, the ball, and advertisement banners around the stadium.
*   **Interactive Camera System:** A fully controllable third-person camera with translation (pan, tilt, zoom) and rotation capabilities, implemented using a custom C++ Vector class.
*   **Game Physics and Collision Detection:** Includes logic for player and ball movement, along with simple, distance-based collision detection to determine when the ball crosses the goal line.
*   **Game Logic & State Management:** Manages the game state with a countdown timer and win/loss conditions, providing a complete, interactive gameplay loop.
*   **Custom Vector Library:** A bespoke `Vector` class was built from scratch to handle 3D mathematical operations essential for graphics programming, including cross product, dot product, normalization, and operator overloading for efficient geometric and camera calculations.

## Technical Stack

*   **Language:** C++
*   **Graphics API:** OpenGL
*   **Libraries:**
    *   **GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit):** For windowing and input handling.
    *   **GLEW (OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library):** For managing OpenGL extensions.

## How to Compile and Run

1.  Open the `OpenGLMeshLoader.sln` file in a compatible version of Visual Studio.
2.  The required libraries (`glut32.lib`, `glew32.lib`) and headers are included in the root directory. Ensure the project's Linker and C/C++ settings are configured to find them.
3.  Build the solution (F7 or Build > Build Solution).
4.  Run the application (F5 or Debug > Start Debugging). The executable will be generated in the `Debug/` directory.

## Project Structure

*   `OpenGLMeshLoader19.cpp`: The main application file containing the game logic, rendering loop, and OpenGL initialization.
*   `Model_3DS.h` / `.cpp`: Handles the parsing and loading of `.3DS` model files.
*   `GLTexture.h` / `.cpp`: Manages loading and binding of texture files.
*   `/models`: Contains the `.3DS` models and their associated texture maps.
*   `/textures`: Contains general textures for the environment, like the football field.
*   `glut.h`, `glew.h`, etc.: Core library files for OpenGL development.
